"1 The number of agencies used to compile these figures differs from other tables that include data about law enforcement officers because agencies with no resident population are excluded from this table. Agencies not included in this table are associated with universities and colleges (see Table 79) and other agencies (see Table 81), as well as some state agencies that have concurrent jurisdiction with other local law enforcement.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Because of rounding, the percentages may not add to 100.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,
