1,1,TEXAS Grants,BSS/ B.1.1,"This request will allow 158,719 students with an Expected family Contribution (EFC) up to $8,000 to receive a TEXAS Grant in the biennium. This will fund nearly 100% of all eligible new university students and an estimated 41,225 new transfer students that have not previously been eligible for the Program.",38537345,67970755,106508100,0,D4
2,1,DCS,ISS/ I.1.2,"The agency is one of 27 state agencies mandated to use the Data Center Services contract for our computer center operations.  This contract provides essential day-to-day services related to print services and server/network operations for the agency.  Based on the FY13 baseline and projected FY14 and FY15 DCS costs provided by DIR, we are requesting the additional capital funding to offset the projected shortfall + 12% growth in storage needs which is needed to keep the growing amount of data that the agency is required to keep.",199146,344776,543922,0,D27
3,2,Teach for Texas LRP,BSS/ B.1.10,"Current biennium funding at $1million represents a 91% reduction, compared with the 2010-2011 biennium. This required that we reduce annual loan repayment awards from $5,000 to $2,500 and that we accept applications only from prior year recipients. Awards for the current year will be disbursed for only 44% of those who were invited to apply. With an additional $9 million in funding, we will be able to contribute to the retention of 900 additional teachers per year, if the annual award amount is restored to $5,000, or 1,800 additional teachers, if the award amount remains at $2,500.",4500000,4500000,9000000,0,D9
4,1,Graduate Medical Education Expansion Effort,WAAR/ D.1.4,"Texas must quickly increase the number of first year entering medical residents or Texas medical school graduates will no longer have enough available first year residency positions to retain its medical school graduates. The proposed Graduate Medical Education Expansion Effort would provide funding support to Texas residency programs offering first year residency positions. The goal of the program would be to achieve a 1.1 to 1 ratio of Texas first-year entering positions to medical school graduates. The new funding of $11.7 million ($15,000 per resident x 779 positions) would support 10 percent of the cost for new first-year entering residency training positions beginning in the 2014-2015 biennium. The program would support the addition of 220 first-year entering residency positions beginning in 2014, and allow the residents to continue training, and add 339 first-year entering residents in 2015. The administration and management of the new program would be absorbed by the agency with existing staff, with less than 2 percent of the proposed funding used to support salaries and wages.",5750000,5750000,11500000,0,D15
5,2,Texas Science Technology Engineering and Math,WAAR/ B.1.19,"The Texas Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (T-STEM) Challenge Scholarship Program was established by House Bill 2910, passed by the 82nd Legislature, Regular Session in 2011.

6,3,Family Practice Residency Program,WAAR/ D.1.1,"The Family Practice Residency Program (FPRP) improves the distribution of family physicians throughout the state and provides increased medical care to patients in underserved areas. Funds are allocated based on the certified number of residents training in each approved family practice residency program, which must receive significant local support to qualify for state funds. This strategy also supports rural and public health rotations, which offer family practice residents the opportunity for supervised training in a rural community or public health facility. Since its inception in 1979, the program has provided funding support for more than 8,000 family practice residents. Family physicians who complete residency training have a 70 percent retention rate in Texas. The exceptional item request for an additional $10 million to the current level of funding of $5.6 million would allow the per resident funding level to increase from the current level of $3,985 to $10,764 to support approximately 706 family practice residents, and provide for an increase in the number of rural and public health rotations that could be completed from the current level of 25 funded at $2,000 to 80 funded at $2,500.",5000000,5000000,10000000,0,D13

The established peer-review process ensures that selected research projects are at the forefront of science: research that attracts and retains the best faculty and students and develops the knowledge base needed for continuing innovation. NHARP funds enable investigators to do initial studies necessary to secure additional funding from the federal government, private industry, not-for-profit organizations, and private donors.",8000000,0,8000000,0,D12

The Engineering Recruitment Program (ERP) helps close the gaps in participation and success, specific to engineering, through  the Engineering Summer Program (ESP). The ESP supports one-week summer program experiences for middle and high school students at Texas public and private general academic institutions that offer engineering degree programs. ESP students participate in courses similar in content to engineering courses, with a focus on math and science preparation. The ESP is an early intervention initiative to engage and encourage middle and high school students to consider engineering as a profession.  The program was not funded in FYs 2012 and 2013. In FY 2011, the ESP received an appropriation of $500,000 and supported 25 summer programs with 790 middle and high school students participating. Approximately half the number of programs and students would be supported, if funding were provided in FYs 2014 and 2015.",250000,250000,500000,0,D10

Currently, funding is provided to the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) under General Appropriations Act, Senate Bill 1, 82nd Texas Legislature, B.3.1. Strategy: EMS AND TRAUMA CARE SYSTEMS (page II-49).  In turn, DSHS provides the Coordinating Board with funding through a Memorandum of Understanding. To reduce unnecessary administrative effort between agencies, a request would be made that this appropriation go directly to the Coordinating Board. DSHS has indicated it will not request funding in the 2014-2015 LAR since it has no statutory authority for the program.",2250000,2250000,4500000,0,D19
10,3,Physician Ed. LRP,BSS/ D.1.6,"The Physician Education Loan Repayment Program (PELRP) provides student loan repayment awards for physicians who have agreed to provide four years of service for underserved Texans in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs).

12,2,Acquisition of Information Technology Resources,ISS/ I.1.2,"With no capital funding having been approved for technology acquisitions in FY12-13, funding of capital acquisitions in the FY 14-15 biennium is essential to the maintenance of agency operations and staff productivity.
