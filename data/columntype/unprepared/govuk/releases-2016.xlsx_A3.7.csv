"Failures per 100,000 incidences of release",**,**,**,**,**,**,**,-,-,**,**,**,**,**,**,**
(1) Sentence type is based on the prisonerâ€™s custody type at the point of their first ROTL of the quarter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) One individual may be released on temporary licence in more than quarter of the year. Users should therefore not sum four quarters worth of data for the annual number of prisoners released on temporary licence. Annual figures are provided in the annual releases tables, typically published in April of each year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) The other sentence type category includes fine defaulters and non-criminal prisoners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) Not all temporary release failures are recorded on central administrative systems. Those that are not recorded centrally are more likely to be low-level failures including, for example, returning with unauthorised possessions and failing alcohol meter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5) In 2006 the categories of releases on temporary licence (ROTL) were changed following a review of the policy. The new licences are described in Prison Service Order 6300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6) Total includes one incidence of ROTL for which the category was not recorded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(7) A new prison database system was introduced mid 2009 (P-NOMIS). The migration of data from the old system (LIDS) to P-NOMIS affected the supply of data for statistical purposes from July 2009 to February 2010. Data for 2009 is taken from Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2009, in which volumes for 2009 were estimated using data from the first half of the year and rounded to the nearest 100. Data for 2010 is unavailable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(8) Due to improvements in IT systems, the 2015 prison admissions data is now taken from a different source and, for statistical reporting purposes only, are produced using a different method. The 2015 figures from both the old and new systems have been presented to aid comparison.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(r) Historical figures have been revised following a reconciliation exercise of temporary release failure data. Previous figures were based on data from different sources extracted at different times. While figures at the time of publication reflected the data extracted, further incidents and details may have been added since. Previous data from the various sources have been amalgamated and cleansed to form the main source of temporary release failure data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
