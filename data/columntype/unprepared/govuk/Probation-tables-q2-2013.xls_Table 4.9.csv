"(1) From March 2013, there has been a phased introduction and rollout of a national case management system across all Probation Trusts (n-Delius).  As at 30 June 2013, 19 trusts have migrated to the new system.  As a result of that migration, there has been an increase in the number of offenders within the migrated Trusts with an unrecorded tier of supervision.  Investigations are being undertaken to identify the source of this issue and resolve it as soon as possible.",,,,,,,
