"Data are weighted to be representative of total employment in England (not workplaces), so a result of 10% should be interpreted as workplaces accounting for 10% of employment are....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Region, workplace size and industry all relate to the workplace. For workplaces that are part of larger organisations region, workplace size and industry may differ from that of the enterprise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Table sub-totals may not sum to total due to rounding. Unweighted totals are rounded to the nearest 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
