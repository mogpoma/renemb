"(2) The time served including remand is calculated as the difference between the date of initial entry to prison and the date of release. For those offenders that are recalled to custody, the date of entry is taken to be the date of initial entry for the original set of offences committed and not the date in which the offender returned to custody for the breach of their licence. Therefore, for prisoners that have been recalled to custody, the time served measurement will include a period where the offender was actually on licence in the community instead of in prison custody. This is the reason why, on occassion, the average time served figure may be greater than the average sentence length figure.",,,,,,
