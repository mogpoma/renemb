,tie.,,sold off  Palo Verde for He 8 to import net of 335Mw. Against my direction
,,,Frank directed me to cut the sale to 50Mw so he could import the energy.
2000-03-18 00:00:00,El Paso deficient for HE 11 due to the loss of,Jessie and Ward,"Per Jessie at 1015 MST, I had to cut SRP from 50 MW to 25 MW for HE 11 at the half due to the"

2000-04-28 00:00:00,"~23:25 just a minute of 40spin and 0 non spin.  We were running tight, Phil told me to relax, it will average out OK, and our next hour was looking fine.",Brian,for the hour that we were in.  They kept in the 62 MW for HE18.
2000-07-23 00:00:00,11:25  Only a couple of minutes of spin deficient due to Copper not being able to turn on,Monika and Joe,We discussed of turning Copper on to cover the load for that hour since nobody had anything to sell. Besides Copper was much cheaper than the prices to purchase energy. At the last minute I learned that Copper had trouble getting on and had to buy spin reserves from LADWP for that hour. This helped the spin get back on track
2000-07-26 00:00:00,"HE12,14 couple minutes spin deficient",Leaf to Thomas,Had to buy within the hour 12 and 14 load is rising hot as pistols

2000-07-27 00:00:00,HE 10 for about 15-20 minutes,Leaf to Thomas,"Load jump, bought from APS @ 20 till 50MW int to a 17"
2000-07-27 00:00:00,HE 11 last 20mins should average out to requirments,,77 early in the hour 55 most the hour should be good for the hour
2000-09-09 00:00:00,HE 17 for 10-15 minutes,Leaf to Sal,"Newman 4 went down bought from PNM,IID,and LADWP"
2000-09-09 00:00:00,HE 18 part of the hour,Leaf to Tate,Bought from Pac 50MW on the 1/2 to cover the lack Gen guys didn't put the the buy in the scrape after repeated requests but Tate asured me that it would all work out buy the end of the hour.
2000-09-10 00:00:00,HE 9 10 after to a little after the half,Leaf to ?,Newman 3 not able to handle load shown in the scrape. Cut econ schedules to cover load.
2000-09-10 00:00:00,HE 10 for about 15 minutes,Leaf to ?,Newman 3 went down started copper to cover load.
2000-10-04 00:00:00,HE 19 for about 15 minutes,Leaf to Ward,Load jumped a bit and spin dipped to 30 came back up to 54 later in the hour bought from IID to avoid further mishaps.
2000-11-09 00:00:00,HE 7 last twenty minutes,,We were good the first half of the hour then we started to slip. Since we were going to be fat in HE 8 I didn't want to cut the schedules
2000-11-17 00:00:00,HE 7,Guzman and Thomas,"Could not close breaker on Copper, bought 50 mws from LDWP to cover at $225, naturally they got the breaker closed as we ramped into the next hour."
2000-12-26 00:00:00,HE18,Leaf,Load came up more than expected I didn't cut schedules because I thought that the spin in the first half of the hour would average out to the requirements. Unfortunately load kept jumping.
