Please note:,,,,
"The industrial contribution for an IPA is 10% of the total project costs, not 10% of the fEC requested from BBSRC.",,,,
The amount requested from BBSRC is the amount that goes in the Je-S form in the fEC boxes,,,,
The industrial contribution is put on the Je-S form using the 'project partners' box,,,,
If the industrial contribution is >10% these calculations will no longer be accurate.,,,,
