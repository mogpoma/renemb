1. Number of persons who registered to vote at the polling place,,,,,,,,,,,
updated 1/15/09,,,,,,,,,,,
"The numbers are the count of registered voters as reported by city and town clerks after the polls closed at the November 4, 2008 General Election.  Because town supervisors of the checklist and city registrars need to meet in public session to authorize the removal of voters from the checklist, voters who registered on election day who were already registered to vote in another N.H. city or town are counted as registered voters in both places.  Updated numbers will be posted after all the cities and towns have removed those voters who moved and registered on election day in some other town or ward in New Hampshire.",,,,,,,,,,,
