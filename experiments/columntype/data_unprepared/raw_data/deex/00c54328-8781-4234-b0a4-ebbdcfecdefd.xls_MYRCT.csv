Some NSSE administrations at an institution may yield more precise population estimates than others. The values in this table were drawn from the Respondent Characteristics reports for each NSSE administration. An important early step in conducting a multi-year analysis is to review the quality of your data for both first-year and senior respondents in each year.,,,,,,,,,,,

a All NSSE administration years since 2004 are listed regardless of participation.,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Modes include Paper (students receive a paper survey and the option of completing a Web version), Web (students receive all 
  correspondence by e-mail and complete the Web version), and Web+ (students initially invited to participate via e-mail; a subgroup 
  of nonrespondents receive paper surveys).",,,,,,,,,,,
"c Response rates (number of respondents divided by sample size) were adjusted for ineligibility, nondeliverable mailing addresses, 
  and  students who were unavailable during the survey administration.",,,,,,,,,,,
"d Sampling error gauges the precision of estimates based on a sample survey. It is an estimate of how much survey item percentages for 
  your respondents could differ from those of the entire population of students at your institution. Data with larger sampling errors 
  (such as +/-10%) need not be dismissed out of hand, but any results using them should be interpreted more conservatively.",,,,,,,,,,,
"e This is the original count used to calculate response rates and sampling errors for each administration's Respondent Characteristics 
  report. This number includes all randomly sampled students. In 2004 and 2005 it may also include targeted oversamples. For this 
  reason, the counts for 2004 and 2005 may not match those given in the detailed statistics on pages 5 and 7.",,,,,,,,,,,
