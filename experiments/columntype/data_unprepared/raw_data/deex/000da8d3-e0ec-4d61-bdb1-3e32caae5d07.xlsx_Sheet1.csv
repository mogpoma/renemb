"This report is run by the date the crimes occurred. Because both reporting of crimes and data entry can be a month or more behind, not all crimes have been recorded yet. This can create a false reduction in crime in both property and violent crimes. For a more accurate week to week or month to month or current period to same period in a previous year comparison, it is best to compare periods that are between 30 and 60 days prior to the current date. The only certified crime statistics are the UCRs. The statistical totals are based on the number of incidents, not the number of victims.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
