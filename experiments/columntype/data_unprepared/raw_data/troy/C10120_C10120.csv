"Note: After-tax income quintiles constitute one method of categorising a population by income. The lowest quintile represents the 20% of the population whose income is lowest. By the same token, the highest quintile represents the 20% of the population whose income is highest.",,,,,,
"1. The ""implicit"" rate of either transfers or taxes demonstrates the relative importance of transfers received or taxes paid. For a given individual or family, the implicit rate is the amount of transfers or taxes expressed as a percentage of their total income.",,,,,,
