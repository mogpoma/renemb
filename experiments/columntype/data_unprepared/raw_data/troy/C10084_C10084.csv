"Note: Canada totals in the provincial economic accounts (PEA) do not correspond to the national income and expenditure accounts (IEA) estimates at certain times of the year. Preliminary PEA estimates produced each spring are benchmarked to the IEA's initial (fourth quarter) release. The IEA's annual revisions, released later each spring, result in a discrepancy between the estimates. The PEA are brought back in line when the IEA's annual revisions are incorporated each fall.",,,,,
