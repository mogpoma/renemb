Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,
"1   Figures relate to the number of disposals for each type of financial remedy order. Therefore the above figures do not compare to those figures in Table 10, as that table gives the number of disposals in which one or more types of financial remedy orders were made.",,,,,,,,,,,
2   Uncontested applications do not have a court hearing.,,,,,,,,,,,
