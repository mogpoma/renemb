"1. Risks for vandalism, domestic burglary, vehicle-related theft, bicycle theft and other household theft are based on households. Risks for theft from the person, snatch theft, stealth theft, other theft of personal property, all BCS violence, wounding, assault with minor injury, assault with no injury and robbery are based on adults. ",,,,,
"2. The range given for these estimates is based on a 95 per cent confidence interval (see Section 8). Estimates based on subsamples (for example, age group) will have larger confidence intervals (see Table 8.04).",,,,,
"3. 'All violence' includes wounding, assault with minor injury, assault with no injury and robbery. See Section 5 for more information.",,,,,
4. Unweighted base refers to high level of worry about burglary. Base size for car crime will be lower as based on vehicle-owning households only.,,,,,
5. Unweighted base refers to effectiveness of CJS. Base size for fairness of CJS is similar.,,,,,
