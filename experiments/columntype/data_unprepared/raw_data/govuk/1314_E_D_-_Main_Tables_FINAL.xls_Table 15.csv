Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) Figures for 2011/12 onwards are not directly comparable to earlier years as a Single Individualised Learner Record (ILR) data collection system has been introduced. More information on the Single ILR is available at: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140107201041/http://www.thedataservice.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/C05DCDD5-67EE-4AD0-88B9-BEBC8F7F3300/0/SILR_Effects_SFR_Learners_June12.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) Success rates are calculated as the number of learning aims achieved divided by the number of starts, excluding any learners who transferred onto another qualification within the same organisation. Learners who withdrew within the first 6 weeks of the qualification are excluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
