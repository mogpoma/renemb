(1) Nationality is based on self-reporting by prisoners and ahs not been independently verified,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) In prisons, as in the community, it is not possible to identify every self-harmer with absolute accuracy. In prison custody, however, such indivduals are more likely to be detected and counted. Care needs to be taken when comparing figures shown here with other sources where data may be less complete. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) The numbers in each category are based on the recorded nationality of an individual when the self-harm incident took place.  As a result, individuals may appear in more than one category during a year.  The numbers may be compared with the numbers of incidents in the same categories as shown in table 3.",,,,,,,,,,,
(4) the 'All Nationality Types' total refers to the number of individuals for the year. It is NOT the sum of the categories for the reasons mentioned in point (3). ,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data Sources and Quality
These figures have been drawn from the NOMS Incident Reporting System. Care is taken when processing and analysing returns but the detail is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system. Although shown to the last individual, the figures may not be accurate to that level.",,,,,,,,,,,
