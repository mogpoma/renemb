"(1) Deaths in prison custody figures include all deaths of prisoners arising from incidents during prison custody.  They include deaths of prisoners while released on temporary license (ROTL) for medical reasons but exclude other types of ROTL where the state has less direct responsibility. In recent years, approximately one quarter of self-inflicted deaths in prison custody actually occur in hospitals or hospices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) The 'Privacy screen furniture etc.' and 'Toilet/sink fittings/recess' categories were added in 2004 and ligature points reclassified.  However, there may be some under reporting against this category in the early years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) Although there are a number of deaths that remain unclassified in 2010 (awaiting further information) the numbers in this table are not affected.  If any of the unclassified deaths are self-inflcted then it it is likely that the method would be either overdose or poison and not hanging/self-strangulation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data Sources and Quality
These figures are derived from the NOMS Deaths in Prison Custody database.  As classification of deaths may change following inquest or as new information emerges numbers may change from time to time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
