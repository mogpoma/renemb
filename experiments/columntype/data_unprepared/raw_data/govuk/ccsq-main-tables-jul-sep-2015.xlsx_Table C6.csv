Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) The reporting period is defined by the date on which the defendant was dealt with.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) The stage at which a defendant pleaded guilty is calculated from the hearing type entered by the court,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) Defendants with more than one case will be counted more than once,,,,,,,,,,,,
4) A guilty plea is recorded when a defendant: (i) pleads guilty to all counts; (ii) pleads guilty to some counts and not guilty to others and no jury is sworn in respect of the not guilty counts; or (iii) pleads not guilty to some or all counts but offers a guilty plea to alternatives which are accepted (providing no jury is sworn in respect of the other counts).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5) Prior to trial includes guilty pleas entered at plea, at the plea and case management hearing or at a newton hearing (no further trial time required)",,,,,,,,,,,,
"6) The guilty plea(s) was entered at hearings types other than at plea hearings, plea and case management hearings, plea and directions hearings, newton hearings, trial hearing and cracked trial hearings",,,,,,,,,,,,
