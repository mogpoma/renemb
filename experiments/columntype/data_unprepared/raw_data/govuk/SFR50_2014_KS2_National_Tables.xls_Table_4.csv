1.  Pupils are expected to make at least two levels of progress between KS1 and KS2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.  For reading and mathematics, where a pupil has a non-numerical KS2 test result, the teacher assessment result is taken into account in deciding the KS2 level.  For writing, the KS2 level is based entirely on teacher assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.  2014 figures are based on revised data. Final data has been used for all other years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4.  State-funded schools include academies, free schools, city technology colleges and state-funded special schools but exclude Independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools and pupil referral units.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.  State-funded mainstream schools include academies, free schools and city technology colleges but exclude state-funded special schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, special academies and pupil referral units.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6.  Number of pupils at the end of KS2 included in the progress measure.  In most cases, these pupils must have valid KS2 results and valid results at KS1 (excluding absent (A) and disapplied (D)).  The exception is for pupils who achieved level W, 1 or 6 at KS2 – these pupils are included even if they do not have a valid KS1 result. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7.  The participation rate of state-funded schools in the 2010 tests was approximately 74% due to industrial action.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8.  2011 to 2014 figures are produced from the national pupil database.  Figures for all other years are produced from the primary school performance tables data. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
