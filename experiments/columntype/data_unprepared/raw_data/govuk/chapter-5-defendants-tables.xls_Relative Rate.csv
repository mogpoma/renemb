"(1) The figures given in the table relate to defendants for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.",,,,,,,,,,,
(2) Data are given on a principal disposal basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) Figures exclude persons where sex ""Not Stated"" and other offenders, i.e. companies, public bodies, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.",,,,,,,,,,,
(5) RRI is a means of comparing the rates of CJS contact experienced by different groups. A rate is defined as the count of persons experiencing an event or outcome out of the total number of people who were ‘at-risk’ for experiencing the event or outcome.
