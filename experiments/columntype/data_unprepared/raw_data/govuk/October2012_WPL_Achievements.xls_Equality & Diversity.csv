Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) The following data sources have been used; Work based learning (WBL) – 2007/08 and earlier years (W13 final), 2008/09 (E13 final), 2009/10 (E13 final), 2010/11 (ER13 final), 2011/12 (R14).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) Figures for 2008/09 onwards are not comparable with earlier years as from 2008/09 onwards NVQs delivered in the workplace changed from being funded by FE to be funded by Train to Gain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) This table shows full year estimates for 2011/12.  It is not possible to directly compare provisional 2011/12 estimates with figures for previous years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4) Workplace Learning includes Train to Gain and other Employer Responsive provision (except Apprenticeships).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5) Volumes are rounded to the nearest ten except for dimension Grand Totals which are rounded to the nearest hundred.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6) '-' indicates a base value of less than five. '*' indicates a percentage of less than 0.5%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7) Percentages are based on unrounded figures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8) The full-year numbers are a count of the number of starts at any point during the year.  Learners starting more than one course will appear more than once.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9) Age is calculated based on age at start of the programme rather than based on 31 August.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10) Age, gender, learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities and ethnicity is based upon self-declaration by the learner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11) Ethnicity categories have been aligned with the ethnicities recorded in the 2011 UK Census.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12) These tables include some learners aged under 19 who are eligible for funding on certain Workplace Learning programmes (such as Programmes for the Unemployed).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
