"1 The data collection methodology for the offense of forcible rape used by the Minnesota state UCR Program (with the exception of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota) does not comply with national UCR Program guidelines.  Consequently, their figures for forcible rape and violent crime (of which forcible rape is a part) are not published in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,
2 The FBI does not publish arson data unless it receives data from either the agency or the state for all 12 months of the calendar year.,,,,,,,,,,,
