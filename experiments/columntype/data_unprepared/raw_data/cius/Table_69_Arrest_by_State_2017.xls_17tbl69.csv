"NOTE:  Because the number of agencies submitting arrest data varies from year to year, users are cautioned about making direct comparisons between 2017 arrest totals and those published in previous years' editions of Crime in the United States. Further, arrest figures may vary widely from state to state because some Part II crimes are not considered crimes in some states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
